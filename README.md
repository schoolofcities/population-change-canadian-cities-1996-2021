Data for this map come from the 1996 and 2021 Canadian census. Data for 1996 were accessed at the University of Toronto and were linked to 2021 census tracts using the [Canadian Longitudinal Tract Database](https://github.com/jamaps/CLTD). Data for 2021 were downloaded from [Statistics Canada](). `json` data with population by census tract for both these years displayed on the map can be accessed [here](src/assets/ct-pts.geo.json).
